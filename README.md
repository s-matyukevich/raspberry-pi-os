## Learning Operating System development using Linux kernel and Raspberry Pi.

This repository contains complete guide that teaches how to create your own simple operating system from scratch. The source code for the OS is largely based on [Linux kernl](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and it is desined to be run on [Raspberry PI 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) device. For more information about the project goals and history please read the Introduction. The project is still under an active devlopment, if you want to participate - please read the contribution guide.
