## Prerequisites


### 1. [Raspberry Pi 3 model b](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) 

Older versions of Raspberry Pi are not going to work with this tutorial, because all lessons are designed to use 64 bit processor that supports ARM.v8 architecture and such processor is only available in Raspberry Pi 3 model.

### 2. [USB to TTL serial cable](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=usb+to+ttl+serial+cable&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ausb+to+ttl+serial+cable) 

After you get serial cable you need to test you connection. If you never done this before I recommend you to follow [this guide](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable.pdf) It describes the process of connecting your raspberry Pi via serial cabel in great details. One thin that I can recomment you to do is to use your serial cable to power your Raspberry Pi. How to do this is described in the previous link.
