## 4.1: Scheduler 

By now, the PRi OS is already a fairly complicated bare metal program, but to be honest, we still can't call it an operating system. The reason is that it can't do any of the core tasks that any OS should do. One of such core tasks is called process scheduling. By scheduling I mean that an operating system should be able to share CPU time between different processes. The hard part of it is that a process should be unaware of the scheduling happening: it should view itself as the only one occupying the CPU. In this lesson, we are going to add this functionality to the RPi OS.

### task_struct

If we want to manage processes, the first thing we should do is to create a struct that describes a process. Linux has such a struct and it is called `task_struct`  (in Linux both thread and processes are just different types of tasks). As we are mostly mimicking Linux implementation, we are going to do the same. RPi OS [task_struct](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/sched.h#L36) looks like the following.

```
struct cpu_context {
    unsigned long x19;
    unsigned long x20;
    unsigned long x21;
    unsigned long x22;
    unsigned long x23;
    unsigned long x24;
    unsigned long x25;
    unsigned long x26;
    unsigned long x27;
    unsigned long x28;
    unsigned long fp;
    unsigned long sp;
    unsigned long pc;
};

struct task_struct {
    struct cpu_context cpu_context;
    long state;    
    long counter;
    long priority;
    long preempt_count;
};
```

This struct has the following members:

* `cpu_context` This is an embedded structure that contains values of all registers that might be different between the tasks, that are being switched. A reasonable question to ask is why do we save not all registers, but only registers `x19 - x30` and `sp`? (`fp` is `x29` and `pc` is `x30`) The answer is that actual context switch happens only when a task calls [cpu_switch_to](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.S#L4) function. So, from the point of view of the task that is being switched, it just calls `cpu_switch_to` function and it returns after some (potentially long) time. The task doesn't notice that another task happens to runs during this period.  Accordingly to ARM calling conventions registers `x0 - x18` can be overwritten by the called function, so the caller must not assume that the values of those registers will survive after a function call. That's why it doesn't make sense to save `x0 - x18` registers.
* `state` This is the state of the currently running task. For tasks that are just doing some work on the CPU the state will always be [TASK_RUNNING](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/sched.h#L15). Actually, this is the only state that the RPi OS is going to support for now. However, later we will have to add a few additional states. For example, a task that is waiting for an interrupt should be moved to a different state, because it doesn't make sense to awake the task while the required interrupt hasn't yet happened.
* `counter` This field is used to determine how long the current task has been running. `counter` decreases by 1 each timer tick and when it reaches 0 another task is scheduled.
* `priority`  When a new task is scheduled its `priority` is copied to `counter`. By setting tasks priority, we can regulate the amount of processor time that the task gets relative to other tasks.
* `preempt_count` If this field has a non-zero value it is an indicator that right now the current task is executing some critical function that must not be interrupted (for example, it runs the scheduling function) If timer tick occurs at such time it is ignored and rescheduling is not triggered.

After the kernel startup, there is only one task running: the one that runs [kernel_main](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/kernel.c#L19) function. It is called "init task". Before the scheduler functionality is enabled, we must fill `task_struct` corresponding to the init task. This is done [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/sched.h#L53). 

All tasks are stored in [task](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/sched.h#L53) array. This array has only 64 slots - that is the maximum number of simultaneous tasks that we can have in the RPi OS. It is definitely not the best solution for the production-ready OS, but it is ok for our goals.

There is also a very important variable called [current](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L6) that always points to the currently executing task. Both `current` and `task` array are initially set to hold a pointer to the init task. There is also a global variable called [nr_tasks](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L8) - it contains the number of currently running tasks in the system.

Those are all structures and global variables that we are going to use to implement the scheduler functionality. In the description of the `task_struct` I already briefly mentioned some aspects of how scheduling works, because it is impossible to understand the meaning of a particular `task_struct` field without understanding how this field is used. Now we are going to examine the scheduling algorithm in much more details and we will start with the `kernel_main` function.

### `kernel_main` function

Before we dig into the scheduler implementation, I want to quickly show you how we are going to prove that the scheduler actually works. To understand it, you need to take a look at the [kernel.c](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/kernel.c) file. Let me copy the relevant content here.

```
void kernel_main(void)
{
    uart_init();
    init_printf(0, putc);
    irq_vector_init();
    timer_init();
    enable_interrupt_controller();
    enable_irq();

    int res = copy_process((unsigned long)&process, (unsigned long)"12345");
    if (res != 0) {
        printf("error while starting process 1");
        return;
    }
    res = copy_process((unsigned long)&process, (unsigned long)"abcde");
    if (res != 0) {
        printf("error while starting process 2");
        return;
    }

    while (1){
        schedule();
    }    
}
```

There are a few important things about this code.

1. New function [copy_process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/fork.c#L5) is introduced. `copy_process` takes 2 arguments: a function to execute in a new thread and an argument that need to be passed to this function. `copy_process` allocates a new `task_struct`  and makes it available for the scheduler.
1. Another new function for us is called [schedule](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L21). This is the core scheduler function: it checks whether there is a new task that needs to preemt the current one. A task can voluntarily call `schedule` if it doesn't have any work to do at the moment. `schedule` is also called from the timer interrupt handler.

We are calling `copy_process` 2 times, each time passing a pointer to the [process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/kernel.c#L9) function as the first argument. `process` function is very simple.

```
void process(char *array)
{
    while (1){
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            uart_send(array[i]);
            delay(100000);
        }
    }
}
``` 

It just keeps printing on the screen characters from the array, that is passed as an argument The first time it is called with the argument "12345" and second time the argument is "abcde". If our scheduler implementation is correct, we should see on the screen mixed output from both threads. 

### Memory allocation

Each task in the system should have its dedicated stack. That's why when creating a new task we must have a way to allocate memory. For now, our memory allocator is extremely primitive. (The implementation can be found in [mm.c](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/mm.c) file)

```
static unsigned short mem_map [ PAGING_PAGES ] = {0,};

unsigned long get_free_page()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < PAGING_PAGES; i++){
        if (mem_map[i] == 0){
            mem_map[i] = 1;
            return LOW_MEMORY + i*PAGE_SIZE;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void free_page(unsigned long p){
    mem_map[p / PAGE_SIZE] = 0;
}
```
The allocator can work only with memory pages (each page is 4 KB in size). There is an array called `mem_map` that for each page in the system holds its status: whether it is allocated or free. Whenever we need to allocate a new page, we just loop through this array and return the first free page. This implementation is based on 2 assumptions: 

1. We know the total amount of memory in the system. It is `1 GB - 1 MB` (the last megabyte of memory is reserved for device registers) This value is stored in the [HIGH_MEMORY](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/mm.h#L14) constant.
1. First 4 MB of memory are reserved for the kernel image and init task stack. This value is stored in [LOW_MEMORY](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/mm.h#L13) constant. All memory allocations start right after this point. 

### Creating a new task

New task allocation is implemented in [copy_process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/fork.c#L5) function.

```
int copy_process(unsigned long fn, unsigned long arg)
{
    preempt_disable();
    struct task_struct *p;

    p = (struct task_struct *) get_free_page();
    if (!p)
        return 1;
    p->priority = current->priority;
    p->state = TASK_RUNNING;
    p->counter = p->priority;
    p->preempt_count = 1; //disable preemtion until schedule_tail

    p->cpu_context.x19 = fn;
    p->cpu_context.x20 = arg;
    p->cpu_context.pc = (unsigned long)ret_from_fork;
    p->cpu_context.sp = (unsigned long)p + THREAD_SIZE;
    int pid = nr_tasks++;
    task[pid] = p;    
    preempt_enable();
    return 0;
}
```

Now, we are going to examine it in details. 

```
    preempt_disable();
    struct task_struct *p;
```

The function starts with disabling preemption and allocating a pointer for the new task. Preemption is disabled because we don't want to be rescheduled to a different task in the middle of the `copy_process` function.  

```
    p = (struct task_struct *) get_free_page();
    if (!p)
        return 1;
```

Next, a new page is allocated. At the bottom of this page, we are putting the `task_struct` for the newly created task. The rest of this page will be used as the task stack.

```
    p->priority = current->priority;
    p->state = TASK_RUNNING;
    p->counter = p->priority;
    p->preempt_count = 1; //disable preemtion until schedule_tail
```

After the `task_struct` is allocated, we can initialize its properties.  Priority and initial counter are set based on the current task priority. The state is set to `TASK_RUNNING`, indicating that the new task is ready to be started. `preempt_count` is set to 1, meaning that after the task is executed it should not be rescheduled until it completes some initialization work.

```
    p->cpu_context.x19 = fn;
    p->cpu_context.x20 = arg;
    p->cpu_context.pc = (unsigned long)ret_from_fork;
    p->cpu_context.sp = (unsigned long)p + THREAD_SIZE;
```

This is the most important part of the function. Here `cpu_context` is initialized. The stack pointer is set to the top of the newly allocated memory page. `pc`  is set to the [ret_from_fork](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L146) function, and we need to look at this function now in order to understand why the rest of the `cpu_context` registers are initialized in the way they are.

```
.globl ret_from_fork
ret_from_fork:
    bl    schedule_tail
    mov    x0, x20
    blr    x19         //should never return
```

As you can see `ret_from_fork` first call [schedule_tail](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L65), which just enabled preemption, and then it calls the function stored in `x19` register with the argument stored in `x20`. `x19` and `x20` are restored from the `cpu_context` just before `ret_from_fork` function is called. 

Now, let's go back to `copy_process`.

```
    int pid = nr_tasks++;
    task[pid] = p;    
    preempt_enable();
    return 0;
```

Finally, `copy_process` adds the newly created task to the `task` array and enables preemption for the current task.

An important thing to understand about the `copy_process` function is that after it finishes execution, no context switch happens. The function only prepares new `task_struct` and adds it to the `task` array — this task will be executed only after `schedule` function is called.

### Who calls `schedule`?

Before we get into the details of the `schedule` function, lets first figure out how `schedule` is called. There are 2 scenarios.

1. When some task doesn't have anything to do right now, but it nevertheless can't be terminated, it can call `schedule` voluntarily. That is something `kernel_main` function does.
1. `schedule` is also called on a regular basis from the [timer interrupt handler](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/timer.c#L21).

Now let's take a look at [timer_tick](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L70) function, which is called from the timer interrupt.

```
void timer_tick()
{
    --current->counter;
    if (current->counter>0 || current->preempt_count >0) {
        return;
    }
    current->counter=0;
    enable_irq();
    _schedule();
    disable_irq();
```

First of all, it decreases current task's counter. If the counter is greater then 0 or preemption is currently disabled the function returns, but otherwise`schedule` is called with interrupts enabled. (We are inside an interrupt handler, and interrupts are disabled by default) We will see why interrupts must be enabled during scheduler execution in the next section. 

### Scheduling algorithm

Finally, we are ready to look at the scheduler algorithm. I almost precisely copied this algorithm from the first release of the Linux kernel. You can find the original version [here](https://github.com/zavg/linux-0.01/blob/master/kernel/sched.c#L68)

```
void _schedule(void)
{
    preempt_disable();
    int next,c;
    struct task_struct * p;
    while (1) {
        c = -1;
        next = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < NR_TASKS; i++){
            p = task[i];
            if (p && p->state == TASK_RUNNING && p->counter > c) {
                c = p->counter;
                next = i;
            }
        }
        if (c) {
            break;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < NR_TASKS; i++) {
            p = task[i];
            if (p) {
                p->counter = (p->counter >> 1) + p->priority;
            }
        }
    }
    switch_to(task[next]);
    preempt_enable();
}
```

The algorithm works like the following:

 * The first inner `for` loop iterates over all tasks and tries to find a task in `TASK_RUNNING` state with the maximum counter. If such task is found and its counter is greater then 0, we immediately break from the outer `while` loop and switch to this task. If no such task is found this means that no tasks in `TASK_RUNNING`  state currently exist or all such tasks have 0 counters. In a real OS, the first case might happen, for example, when all tasks are waiting for an interrupt. In this case, the second nested `for` loop is executed. For each task (no matter what state it is in) this loop increases its counter. The counter increase is done in a very smart way:

    1. The more iterations of the second `for` loop a task passes, the more its counter will be increased.
    2. A task counter can never get larger than `2 * priority` 

* Then the process is repeated. If there are at least one task in `TASK_RUNNIG` state, the second iteration of the outer `while` loop will be the last one because after the first iteration all counters are already non-zero. However, if no `TASK_RUNNING` tasks are there, the process is repeated over and over again until some of the tasks will move to `TASK_RUNNING` state. But if we are running on a single CPU, how then a task state can change while this loop is running? The answer is that if some task is waiting for an interrupt, this interrupt can happen while `schedule` function is executed and interrupt handler can change the state of the task. This actually explains why interrupts must be enabled during `schedule` execution. This also demonstrates an important distinction between disabling interrupts and disabling preemption. `schedule` disables preemption for the duration of the whole function. This ensures that nester` schedule` will not be called while we are in the middle of the original function execution. However, interrupts can legally happen during `schedule` function execution.

I paid a lot of attention to the situation were some task is waiting for an interrupt, though this functionality isn't implemented in the RPi OS yet. But I still consider it necessary to understand this case because it is a part of the core scheduler algorithm and similar functionality will be added later. 

### Switching tasks

After the task in `TASK_RUNNING` state with non-zero counter is found, [switch_to](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L56) function is called. It looks like this.

```
void switch_to(struct task_struct * next) 
{
    if (current == next) 
        return;
    struct task_struct * prev = current;
    current = next;
    cpu_switch_to(prev, next);
}
```

Here we check that next process is not the same as the current, and if not, `current` variable is updated. The actual work is redirected to [cpu_switch_to](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.S) function.

```
.globl cpu_switch_to
cpu_switch_to:
    mov    x10, #THREAD_CPU_CONTEXT
    add    x8, x0, x10
    mov    x9, sp
    stp    x19, x20, [x8], #16        // store callee-saved registers
    stp    x21, x22, [x8], #16
    stp    x23, x24, [x8], #16
    stp    x25, x26, [x8], #16
    stp    x27, x28, [x8], #16
    stp    x29, x9, [x8], #16
    str    x30, [x8]
    add    x8, x1, x10
    ldp    x19, x20, [x8], #16        // restore callee-saved registers
    ldp    x21, x22, [x8], #16
    ldp    x23, x24, [x8], #16
    ldp    x25, x26, [x8], #16
    ldp    x27, x28, [x8], #16
    ldp    x29, x9, [x8], #16
    ldr    x30, [x8]
    mov    sp, x9
    ret
``` 

This is the place where the real context switch happens. Let's examine it line by line.
 
```
    mov    x10, #THREAD_CPU_CONTEXT
    add    x8, x0, x10
```

`THREAD_CPU_CONTEXT` constant contains offset of the `cpu_context` structure in the `task_struct`. `x0` contains a pointer to the first argument, which is the current `task_struct` (by current here I mean the one we are switching from).  After the copied 2 lines are executed, `x8` will contain a pointer to the current `cpu_context`

```
    mov    x9, sp
    stp    x19, x20, [x8], #16        // store callee-saved registers
    stp    x21, x22, [x8], #16
    stp    x23, x24, [x8], #16
    stp    x25, x26, [x8], #16
    stp    x27, x28, [x8], #16
    stp    x29, x9, [x8], #16
    str    x30, [x8]
```
Next all calle-saved registers are stored in the order, in wich they are defined in `cpu_context` struture. `x30`, which is the link register and contains function return address, is stored as `pc`, current stack pointer is saved as `sp` and `x29` is saved as `fp` (frame pointer).

```
    add    x8, x1, x10
```

Now `x10` contains an offset of the `cpu_context` structure inside `task_struct`, `x1` is a pointer to the next `task_struct`, so `x8` will contain a pointer to the next `cpu_context`.

```
    ldp    x19, x20, [x8], #16        // restore callee-saved registers
    ldp    x21, x22, [x8], #16
    ldp    x23, x24, [x8], #16
    ldp    x25, x26, [x8], #16
    ldp    x27, x28, [x8], #16
    ldp    x29, x9, [x8], #16
    ldr    x30, [x8]
    mov    sp, x9
```

Callee saved registers are restored from the next `cpu_context`.

```
    ret
```

Function returns to the location pointed to by the link register (`x30`) If we are switching to some task for the first time, this will be [ret_from_fork](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L148) function. In all other cases this will be the location, previously saved in the `cpu_context` by the `cpu_switch_to` function.

### How scheduling works with exception entry/exit?

In the previous lesson, we have seen how [kernel_entry](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L17) and [kernel_exit](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L4) macros are used to save and restore the processor state. After the scheduler has been introduced, a new problem arrives: now it becomes fully legal to enter an interrupt as one task and leave it as a different one. This is a problem, because `eret` instruction, which we are using to return from an interrupts, relies on the fact that return address should be stored in `elr_el1` and processor state in `spsr_el1` registers. So, if we want to switch tasks while processing an interrupt, we must save and restore those 2 registers alongside with all other general purpose registers. The code that does this is very straightforward, you can find the save part [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L35) and restore [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L46)

### Tracking system state during a context switch

We have already examined all source code related to the context switch. However, that code contains a lot of asynchronous interactions that make it difficult to fully understand how the state of the whole system changes over time. In this section I want to make this task easier for you: I want to describe the sequence of events that happen from system startup to the time of the second context switch. For each such event, I will also include a diagram representing the state of the memory at the time of the event. I hope that such representation will help you to get a deep understanding of how the scheduler works. So, let's start!

1. The kernel is initialized and [kernel_main](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/kernel.c#L19) function is executed. The initial stack is configured to start at [LOW_MEMORY](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/include/mm.h#L13), which is 4 MB.
    ```
             0 +------------------+ 
               | kernel image     |
               |------------------|
               |                  |
               |------------------|
               | init task stack  |
    0x00400000 +------------------+
               |                  |
               |                  |
    0x3F000000 +------------------+
               | device registers |
    0x40000000 +------------------+

1. `kernel_main` calls [copy_process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/fork.c#L5) for the first time. New 4 KB memory page is allocated, and `task_struct` is placed at the bottom of this page. (Later I will refer to the task created at this point as "task 1")

1. `kernel_main` volantirely calls [schedule](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L21) function and it desides to run task 1.
1. [cpu_switch_to](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.S#L4) saves calee-saved registers in the init task `cpu_context`, wich is located inside the kernel image.
1. `cpu_switch_to` restores calee-saved registers from task 1 `cpu_context`. `sp` now points to `0x00401000`, link register to [ret_from_fork](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L146) function, `x19` contains a pointer to [process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/kernel.c#L9) function and `x20` a pointer to string "12345", wich is located somewhere in the kernel image.
1. `cpu_switch_to` calls `ret` instruction, which jums to the `ret_from_fork` function.
1. `ret_from_fork` reads `x19` and `x20` registers and  calls `process` function with the argument "12345". After `process` function starts to execute its stack begins to grow.

1. A timer interrupt occured. [kernel_entry](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/entry.S#L17) macro saves all general purpose registers + `elr_el1` and `spsr_el1` to the bottom of task 1 stack.

1. `schedule` is called and it decides to run task 2. But we still run task 1 and its stack continues to grow below task 1 saved registers region. On the diagram, this part of the stack is marked as (int), which means "interrupt stack"

1. `cpu_switch_to` runs task 2. In order to do this, it executes exactly the same sequence of steps that it does for task 1. Task 2 started to execute and it stack grows. Note, that we didn't return from an interrupt at this point, but this is ok because interrupts now are enabled (interrupts have been enabled previously in [timer_tick](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L70) before `schedule` was called)

1. `schedule` is called. It observes that all tasks have their counters set to 0 and set counters to their tasks priorities.
1. `schedule` selects init task to run. (This is because all tasks now have their counters set to 1 and init task is the first in the list). But actually, it would be fully legal for `schedule` to select task 1 or task 2 at this point, because their counters has equal values. We are more interested in the case when task 1 is selected so let's now assume that this is what had happened.
1. `cpu_switch_to` is called and it restores previously saved callee-saved registers from task 1 `cpu_context`. Link register now points [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L63) because this is the place from which `cpu_switch_to` was called last time when task 1 was executed. `sp` points to the bottom of task 1 interrupt stack. 
1. `timer_tick` function resumes execution, starting from [this](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L79) line. It disables interrupts and finally [kernel_exit](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson04/src/sched.c#L79) is executed. By the time `kernel_exit` is called, task 1 interrupt stack is collapsed to 0.

1. `kernel_exit` executes `eret` instruction witch uses `elr_el1` register to jump back to `process` function. Task 1 resumes it normal execution.

The described above sequence of steps is very important — I personally consider it one of the most important things in the whole tutorial. If you have difficulties with understanding it, I can advise you to work on the exercise number 1 from this lesson.

### Conclusion

We are done with scheduling, but right now our kernel can manage only kernel threads: they are executed at EL1 and can directly access any kernel functions or data. In the next 2 lessons we are going fix this and introduce system calls and virtual memory.
